# 911 Calls Capstone Project

## Project Overview

For this capstone project, we analyze 911 emergency call data to gain insights into call volumes, reasons for calls, and temporal patterns. The project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and various data visualization libraries.

## Project Description

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle containing emergency call information, including details such as the type of emergency, location coordinates, and timestamps. The goals of this project include:

- Analyzing trends and patterns in emergency call data.
- Visualizing call volumes over time, by location, and by type of emergency.
- Exploring correlations and insights to aid emergency response planning.

## Installation
**Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/simhayn/emergency-calls.git
    cd emergency-calls
    ```
## Usage
The repository includes separate scripts for genetic mapping and QTL analysis. Here are the main steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Data preprocessing was performed in Excel, resulting in the creation of the `raw_data.csv` file, which contains the processed data ready for analysis. 

2. **Genetic Mapping:**
    - Perform genetic mapping using the `genetic_mapping.R` script.
    ```r
    source("scripts/genetic_mapping.R")
    ```

3. **QTL Analysis:**
    - Conduct QTL analysis using the `qtl_analysis.R` script.
    ```r
    source("scripts/qtl_analysis.R")
    ```

4. **Visualize Linkage Map:**
    - Plot linkage map with the detected QTLs using the `linkage_map_view.R` script.
    ```r
    source("scripts/linkage_map_view.R")
    ```

## Data
The fictive data used in this project include genotypic and phenotypic datasets for basil. These datasets are stored in the `data` directory.
